We propose developing a robotic harvesting solution to collect "windfall" throughout the season with apples as our initial test crop. This solution involves deploying a fleet of automated robots that work together to navigate the orchard, scanning for and collecting salvageable apples. A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) model will be used to coordinate the robots' collaboration, optimizing the collection process. Secondarily, if time permits, we also aim to incorporate vision learning to detect viable fruit in the field. We can also increase the complexity of the challenge by adding obstacles to the environment (e.g. bins and farm workers) and creating different roles for the robots.
